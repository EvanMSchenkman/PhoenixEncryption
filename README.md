# PhoenixEncryption

## Introduction
The Phoenix Encryption project is merely a simple program for users to encrypt or decrypt messages.
Along with the development of the software, I am working to develop my new method of encryption called *PEM*.
PEM is short for Pheonix Encryption Method, and will be the method used to encypt and decrypt all messages.
